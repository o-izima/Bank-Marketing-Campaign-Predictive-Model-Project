# Bank-Marketing-Campaign-Predictive-Model-Project

### Overview
This research project aims to develop predictive models using machine learning (ML) techniques to accurately identify the right set of customers for bank deposit offers. The study will evaluate and compare various ML models, including Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Na√Øve Bayes Classifier, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost).

### Research Questions
#### Main Research Question:
- **How does the predictive performance of traditional single base classifiers (SVC, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees) compare to that of ensemble models (Random Forest) and boosting models (XGBoost, GBM, LightGBM) when applied to the task of predicting the effectiveness of a bank marketing campaign?**

#### Sub-Research Questions:
- **Relative Strengths and Weaknesses of Traditional Single Base Classifiers:**
  - What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of traditional single base classifiers in predicting the effectiveness of the bank marketing campaign?
  - How do their performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) compare to the ensemble and boosting models?

- **Comparison of Ensemble Models and Boosting Models:**
  - How do ensemble models (Random Forest) and boosting models (XGBoost, GBM, LightGBM) differ in their predictive capabilities for assessing the effectiveness of the bank marketing campaign?
  - What insights can be gained regarding their suitability for this specific task?

### Additional Considerations
- Investigate different techniques for model interpretability, such as feature importance analysis, to gain insights into the predictive capabilities of the developed models.

### Repository Structure
- **Data:** Contains datasets used for training and testing the predictive models.
